# Purpose of the Appgefahren App (Heidenheim)

The **Appgefahren App** is currently focused on providing a **digital departure monitor** for Heidenheim and the surrounding region.  
It is implemented as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** and integrates the **smap platform by raumobil** for smart mobility and traffic planning.  

## Core Purposes
- Display real-time departure times for buses and trains in Heidenheim  
- Enable easy and up-to-date mobility planning through the integrated **raumobil smap**  
- Use official **NVBW (Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg)** data as the reliable source for public transport information  
- Deliver a lightweight, accessible solution as a PWA without requiring app store installation

The app is designed to make mobility in Heidenheim more transparent and accessible by offering a simple, digital way to check departures and plan routes.
